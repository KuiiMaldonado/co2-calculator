# <span style="color:skyblue">**PROJECT 1 - CO2E PERSONAL CALC**</span>

## <span style="color:violet">DESCRIPTION:</span>

> Welcome to the CO2e PERSONAL CALCULATOR. CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent) is a metric measure that is used to compare emissions from various greenhouse gases. CO2e includes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the F-gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). With CO2e Calc, you will be able to get a quick estimate on your personal CO2e impact by answering a short survey on how much do you spend on everyday activities such as buying clothes or your electricity bill. Once finished your results will be saved in the page for future reference. You can also clear and do the survey as many times as you want.
