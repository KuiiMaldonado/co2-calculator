## <span style="color:violet">Description</span>

> Welcome to the CO2 PERSONAL CALCULATOR. You will be able to get a quick estimate on your personal CO2 Impact by answering a short survey on how much do you spend on everyday activities such as buying clothes or your electricity bill. Once finished your results will be saved in the page for future reference. You can also clear and do the survey as many times as you want. We included a Weather status on the Nav which gives you tips to reduce your CO2 impact with simple actions. Future features include sharing you results directly to Twitter.
